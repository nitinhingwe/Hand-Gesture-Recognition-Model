# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Model
Building hand gesture recognition model to recognize and classify various hand gestures

Hand gesture recognition (HGR) is a subarea of Computer Vision focusing on classifying a video or image containing dynamic or static hand gestures. The challenge is to create a reliable system that can accurately interpret and classify different hand gestures, such as a fist, palm, or thumbs up, using captured images or videos. This capability is essential for applications in human-computer interaction, sign language translation, and other areas requiring gesture-based control.

Proposed Solution:

The proposed system aims to address the challenge of accurately classifying hand gestures using a deep learning algorithm. This involves the following components:

Data Collection: Utilize the Hand Gesture Recognition Database available on Kaggle, containing 6000 images from 3 individuals with 10 different hand gestures.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected data to handle variations in image quality and consistency. Perform feature extraction to highlight relevant aspects of the hand gestures.

Machine Learning Algorithm: Implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify hand gestures based on the preprocessed data. The CNN will be trained to recognize patterns and features unique to each gesture.

Model Training and Evaluation: Train the CNN using labeled hand gesture images and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy.

Deployment: Save the trained model and deploy it in an application capable of real-time hand gesture recognition. This application will provide predictions and allow for interaction based on recognized gestures.
